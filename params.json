{"name":"PGeo","tagline":"Open source Python library for geographic services","body":"### Welcome to PGeo!\r\nPGeo is a powerful open-source library providing aimed to:\r\n1. Acquire public domain remotely sensed data from different data sources\r\n2. Process and analyze spatial data\r\n3. Visualize and analyze images on the web\r\n4. Disseminate spatial analytical results on the web\r\n\r\n### Open Source\r\nPGeo is a cooperative project, it is easily extensible and anyone can write his own plug-in to enrich the platform with more data sources and more features.\r\n\r\n### Quick Start\r\nThis is a quick example on how to use PGeo.\r\n```python\r\nfrom pgeo.thread.download_threads_manager import Manager\r\n\r\npayload = request.get_json()\r\nfile_paths_and_sizes = payload['file_paths_and_sizes']\r\nfilesystem_structure = payload['filesystem_structure']\r\ntab_id = payload['tab_id']\r\nif tab_id not in managers:\r\n   managers[tab_id] = {}\r\nmgr = Manager(source_name, file_paths_and_sizes, filesystem_structure, tab_id)\r\ntarget_dir = mgr.run()\r\n```\r\nFind out more in the [examples section](https://github.com/geobricks/pgeo/tree/master/examples) of the project.\r\n\r\n### REST Web Services\r\nDo you need to use PGeo over the web?
